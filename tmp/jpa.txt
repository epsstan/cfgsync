JPA:
	- need to create a special class for composite PK
	- must code the bean by hand and add annotations
	- Procedural (C-library like) calls with "EntityManager"
		- disallows polymorphism
	- no transaction retries
	- requires calling flush on EntityManager in a transaction
	- requires a string-based query language
		- string-based query languages are an anti-pattern, not a feature
	- criteria api is not type safe
		- very verbose
	- "persistence context" is an anti-pattern that leads to many bugs
		- LazyInitializationException
	- no parameterized relationships
	- no timezone handling
	- no sharding
	- no temporal data
	- no junit integration
	- no uniquing
	- no object cache
