- not right or wrong, but more like good-fit, bad-fit
- a framework, not a library
	- code generation
	- opinionated
	- perscriptive
- vision/philosophy
	- allows user to understand the sweet spot, and do a good-fit/bad-fit analysis
	- allows Reladomo developers to guide future roadmap.

Reladomo core values/philosophy:
- core criteria:
	1) DRY [DRY]
	2) long lived code [LLC]
	3) agile [AGL]
	4) Persistent Domain based OO (really, this is a consistent choice for the first 3, and is a good match for entity models in the db) [OO]
	
- operating environment
	1) long lived processes (not ls)
	2) java.lang works
		- Java's write once, run anywhere pormise has been a great boon for code sharing
			- anything that threatens that is an anti-pattern
			- everything in java.lang must be usable by any code.
				- this includes java.lang.Thread, java.lang.ThreadLocal and all methods on java.lang.Class
					- environments that do no provide a correct implementation of java, and java.lang specifically, are not supported.
	3) static means one per jvm
	4) private means private. final means final.
	
	
- it's critical to know what you don't want -- spell out the bad-fit cases.
	- stored procedures are an anti-pattern, see below
	- application implemented DAO is an anti-pattern http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/dataaccessobject-138824.html
		- creates a large amount of duplicative code
			- adding a simple attribute can cause a change across a dozen files -- obviously not DRY
		- does not properly address object identity
		- breaks down with relationships
	- Repository/Manager is an anti-pattern
		- C library not DomainOO
		- queries naturally belong to a specific code site, not 
			- code sharing/abstraction for queries should follow normal OO practice, not C library practice
		- 1 method per query doesn't scale; leads to re-using unfit queries
			- leads to a code smell: method that's used from only one site 
				- such a method is better represented as a private scoped method near the call site, not globally public
			- Reladomo finder is not a repository
	- Anemic domain is an anti-pattern
		- Business logic must reside in the domain
	- Services that act as remote procedures are an anti-pattern
		- Services that don't delegate to the domain are an anti-pattern
	- ETL between the physical schema and the domain is an anti-pattern
		- makes writing a near impossibility
		- makes caching a near impossibility
		- makes uniquing a near impossibility
	- string based query language is an anti-pattern
		- makes refactoring nearly impossible
		- makes find-usages nearly impossible
		- makes abstraction nearly impossible
	- pluggable cache is an anti-pattern -- a cache is not a map
	- result sets are not domain objects. Reladomo does not faciliate result-set based programming.
	- schemaless leads to unreadable data in the long run
- an ORM must solve the set/object impedance mismatch
	- deepFetch and the List objects in Reladomo do that to a great extent
- testability is key [LLC, AGL] -- see Testing Philosophy
	- tests should allow reasoning about IO
- object identity must have a sensible contract
- ACID is king
- IO latency reduction is important; bandwidth is not critical on a per-row basis
- vendor neutrality
- temporal persistence must be handled at the framework level, not by the application
	- temporal persistence implementation needs new code and data structures
	- it cannot be composed on top of non-temporal persistence code and data structures
- the "surface area" provided by the Reladomo object/finder api is large
	- attempts at wrapping these will lead to eventual failure
	- Reladomo objects are the application/domain objects
		- hiding these objects (via wrappers, copies, dto's, etc is an anti-pattern)
	- Reladomo finder API are the correct way to find objects.
- code must be generated properly
	- bad code generation is worse than bad
- A database is private storage
	- it's not a public API or a communication channel [AGL]
	- it's not a compute engine (breaks OO/DRY)
	- all access must be from a singular code base
	- Database magic is an anti-pattern
		- identity generation
		- triggers (especially when they modify)
		- db2 bitemporal
- views are a temporay last resort.
	- can't write
	- can't cache
	- can't reason about identity
	- implementations are typically problematic
- We will not comprimise on primary keys.

- stored procs:
			- not testable
			- not vendor neutral; not even a semi-standard
			- does not fit well with a domain based OO paradigm: business logic leaks into the SP
			- cannot accept batch data from the application: causes bad IO patterns (ping pong) for non-trivial use cases.
	- understanding how an existing piece of code works requires intimate knowledge of both java and sql
	- in a mixed sp/app environment, it's virtually impossible to come up with guidelines regarding where a particular
		piece of business logic should be implemented.
	- After converting hundreds of stored procs, we've concluded that the equivalent Java code is faster for 2 reasons:
		- In java, it's much easier to use better algorithms. Better collections (maps, trees, sets, bags, etc) and better
			language constructs (e.g. polymorphism) help tremendously with this.
		- A stored proc has a very limited number of params. This makes it impossible to reduce IO by batching. Batched,
			multi-threaded java code can be an order of magnitude faster.
	- A well written piece of code in Java communicates its intent. A well written piece of SQL typically doesn't.
	- SQL is a poor programming environment:
		- procedural
		- violates DRY, especially when it comes to relationship navigation
		- it promotes a "data stirfry" mentality. this further breaks domain based encapsulation.
		- it's very far from modern programming environments:
			- requires a live db to develop.
			- changes to sp's make it hard to share the db.
			- no debuggers in the modern sense: breakpoints, watches, etc.
			- not easily testable
			- it's difficult to perform routine tasks: loops, conditionals, etc
			- it's not easily modularizable. This is provable by simply looking at the total number of third party
				libraries avaialble for Java and comparing that to SQL. This further violates DRY.
			- Modern OO facilities (refactoring, usage analysis, code coverage, dependency analysis, etc) are missing.
			- lack of basic exception handling (try/catch/finally)
		- no notion of compiling/strong typing. Schema modifications often result in failed sp's at runtime.
		- how do you make a REST call from an sp?
		- Writing sql is difficult and error prone. Writing java to interface with the sp doubly so.
		- compared to a declared mapping layer (ORM), code that invokes sp's is very tightly bound to the database. 
			this makes modern agile approaches much harder with sp's.
		- not even a semi-standard. vendor lock-in is guaranteed.
		- applications that require highly dynamic, user driven queries are nearly impossible to code with stored procs.

- "In truth, this basic approach to slave one model into the terms and approach of the other 
has been the traditional answer to the impedance mismatch, effectively solving the problem by ignoring one half of it."

- implementation inheritance doesn't map well.
	- implementation polymorphism is a niche feature in OO. While not an outright anti-pattern, most
		practitioners warn against using it extensively/deeply.
	- light polymorphism (interfaces) are fine.

- The Schema-Ownership Conflict
	- the database schema itself is not under the direct control of developers, but instead is owned by another group 

- The Dual-Schema Problem
	- refactoring has to happen simultaneously
- Entity Identity Issues
	- if two separate user sessions interact with the same relation in storage, the relational database systems concurrency systems kick in and ensure some form of concurrent access, typically via the transactional metaphor (ACID). If an O/R system retrieves a relation out of storage (essentially forming a view over the data), we now have a second source of data identity, one in the database (protected by the aforementioned transactional scheme), and one in the in-memory object representation of that data, which has no consistent transactional support aside from that built into the language

	- what does this say about transactional integrity if the application code believes the write to have occurred when in fact it hasnt?
	
- The Data Retrieval Mechansim Concern
	- query language not expressive

- The Partial-Object Problem and the Load-Time Paradox
	- For most O/R layers, this means that objects and/or fields of objects must be retrieved in a lazy-loaded manner, obtaining the field data on demand, because retrieving all of the fields of all of the Person objects/relations would clearly be a huge waste of bandwidth for this particular scenario.
